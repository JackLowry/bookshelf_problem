Reward function:
small reward for moving the box
reward based on the improvement of the contact graspnet evaluation
large negative reward for making the object fall out of the box
actionspace:
null action
x points which represent action primitives


on reset:
box location and orientation is randomized against the back wall
run contact graspnet forwardpass on image to estimate the "graspability" of the object

select actions:
Q-NET input: segmented pointcloud where each point has a list of which planes on the cube it corresponds to
question: does the order of the planes matter? should the first plane always be the one facin the camera (etc)
output: a confidence level which represents the chance of a successful action primitive increase graspability at that state

carry out action:
carry out action primtive (form tbd)


graspability check:
find the face facing the camera
check:
    how far the two horizontal edges are apart (less than gripper width)
    check the distance from the horizontal edges to the wall (maximize)
    minimize angle between the face normal and the camera normal
